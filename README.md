# JavaLab6
The app for the sixth Java laboratory contains code from the lab's slides: https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/java/labs/slides/lab_06.pdf

I completed all the compulsory part tasks:

- Creating a mainframe of the application

- Creating a configuration panel on the top of the frame, where the client can select the shape's type, size, color, nr of sides.

* the color can be random generated, if the client selects this option

- Creating a drawing panel in the center of the frame. When the client clicks on this area, a shape is drawn( with the characteristics the client had chosen) 

- Creating a control panel at the bottom of the frame, which contains Save, Load, Reset and Exit buttons. All the buttons are functional. (see the attached photo)

**Besides the png photo which was saved by the apllication, I attached a screenshot with the running app.
