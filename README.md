# JavaLab6
The app for the sixth Java laboratory contains code from the lab's slides: https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/java/labs/slides/lab_06.pdf

I completed all the compulsory part tasks:

- Creating a mainframe of the application

- Creating a configuration panel on the top of the frame, where the client can select the shape's type, size, color, nr of sides. There are two types of shapes: Regular polygon and Special shape (which is, in fact, an ellipse). The color can be random generated, if the client selects this option. If not, he can select one of the available options(pink, blue, green and so on). The number of sides and the size can be selected by choosing one of the displayed numbers in the "spinner".

- Creating a drawing panel in the center of the frame. When the client clicks on this area, a shape is drawn( with the characteristics the client had chosen) 

- Creating a control panel at the bottom of the frame, which contains Save, Load, Reset and Exit buttons. All the buttons are functional. (see the attached saved photo)

**Besides the png photo which was saved by the apllication, I attached a screenshot showing the running app.
